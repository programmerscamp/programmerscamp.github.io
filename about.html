                <li>Learn from each other</li>
                <li>Teach each other</li>

        </div>
        <div id="ComplimentGoal">
            <p>All of this is done in a fun environment where everyone can enjoy while they code beacuse what's the point of
                doing something when you're not having the time of your life.</p>
            <p><b><i>-Ideas are to be respected no matter the age. Ideas
        are created by the "mind". They don't require a specific mindset or
        maturity level.-</i></b></p>
        </div>
        <div id="Ideas">
            <h3><b><u>How Ideas are worked on</u></b></h3>
            <p>Any member of the group proposes his/her idea and members of the group discuss the idea. Programmers of the related
                field work together to then create the idea while other members look at the development and learn from it.
                <i>All of the projects
            are open source and can be found on the group's <a href=
